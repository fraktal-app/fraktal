## Overview

**Fraktal** is a no-code automation platform for building and executing decentralized workflows on the [**Internet Computer (ICP)**](https://internetcomputer.org/). It empowers developers and non-developers alike to create powerful automations using modular **triggers** and **actions** ‚Äî all without writing backend code.

Fraktal abstracts complex integrations across **Web2**, **Web3**, and **AI/LLM** services into composable building blocks. Whether you're reacting to a GitHub issue, automating Telegram bots, posting to Discord, or chaining prompts with AI models - Fraktal makes it possible without servers or infrastructure management.

Workflows run natively on-chain, leveraging [ICP‚Äôs decentralized, serverless architecture](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/overview/what-is-ic/) for **trustless**, **persistent**, and **low-latency** execution. Whether you're a developer, builder, or curious hacker, Fraktal gives you the tools to automate the future one block at a time.

## Core Principles

- **Trustless & Serverless Execution**: Fraktal workflows run entirely on the Internet Computer, leveraging decentralized canister smart contracts for persistent, verifiable, and censorship-resistant automation ‚Äî with no centralized servers or backend infrastructure required.

- **Modular Design**: Built around composable triggers and actions, Fraktal enables users to create powerful, reusable automation logic without writing custom backend code.

- **Interoperability**: Fraktal bridges Web2, Web3, and AI ecosystems through integrations with platforms like GitHub, Telegram, Discord, LLMs, and blockchain wallets.

- **No-Code Accessibility**: Fraktal is designed for developers and non-developers alike ‚Äî empowering anyone to build, visualize, and deploy complex automations with ease.

## Features

#### 1. Visual Workflow Builder
- Build and edit automations using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
- Define triggers, actions, and data flows without writing backend code.
- Chain blocks and monitor state visually.

#### 2. Modular Trigger-Action Blocks
- Every workflow is composed of reusable **blocks**:
  - **Triggers**: Listen for events (e.g., Telegram messages, GitHub webhooks).
  - **Actions**: Perform tasks (e.g., send Discord message, prompt an LLM model).
- Add new integrations easily by creating or installing new blocks.

#### 3. On-Chain Execution, Secure by Design
- Powered by the [Internet Computer (ICP)](https://internetcomputer.org/):
  - Workflows run entirely on-chain in tamper-proof smart contract canisters.
  - No centralized servers or third-party hosting.
  - Fully decentralized, scalable, and censorship-resistant by design.
  - Persistent storage, transparent logic, and no vendor lock-in.

#### 4. Cross-Platform Integrations
- Connect services across Web2, Web3, and AI ecosystems:
  - **Telegram**: Bot commands, message replies.
  - **Discord**: Server message triggers, bot mentions, automated replies.
  - **GitHub**: Respond to issues, pull requests, and pushes.
  - **Email**: Send templated notifications directly from workflows.
  - **Web3 Wallets**: Query balances, track activity.
  - **Token Prices**: Fetch live crypto prices and react to market changes.
  - **AI/LLMs**: Generate text, summaries, or decisions using GPT-like models.

#### 5. Real-Time Event Handling
- Fraktal listens for live events and immediately executes workflows.
- Webhooks and message listeners allow near-instant response across platforms.

#### 6. Data Export & Interoperability
- Each block can export its output for downstream use.
- Chain AI outputs to message actions, or wallet data to price alerts.
- Create modular, composable, and reusable automation logic.

## Usage Guide


#### 1. Create a New Flow

- Go to the **Fraktal** dashboard.
- Click **"Create Flow"**.


#### 2. Add a Trigger

Every automation starts with a **Trigger Block** ‚Äî an event that kicks off your flow.
Examples:
- New message on Telegram
- Mention in Discord
- GitHub push/commit

Drag a trigger from the sidebar into the canvas. Configure the block by entering the required parameters. You can export data from the trigger for usage in the next blocks.


#### 3. Add Actions

Next, attach one or more **Action Blocks** that perform tasks when the trigger fires.

You can:
- Send messages on Telegram/Discord
- Query wallet data
- Fetch token prices
- Run an LLM (AI) prompt
- Send email alerts
- Or combine them all!

Drag a action from the sidebar into the canvas. Configure the block by entering the required parameters. Some field that have `$` can use exported data from previous blocks.

#### 4. Save Your Flow

- Use the **Save Workflow** 
- Add a title and click save
- Your workflow is now live!

## Supported Integrations

Fraktal currently supports blocks for:

- **Telegram** ‚Äì Bots, message-based triggers, and actions.
- **Discord** ‚Äì Server events, message actions, and user interactions.
- **GitHub** ‚Äì Issues, pull requests, push events, and repo automation.
- **Web3** ‚Äì Wallet tracking, token prices, balances, and ENS resolution.
- **AI/LLMs** ‚Äì Text generation, summarization, and prompt chaining.
- **Email** ‚Äì Template-based email sending with services like SendGrid.

More integrations and advanced conditionals (filters, branches, loops) are coming soon.

For a full breakdown of available blocks, their parameters, and usage examples, see [`Blocks Information`](./docs/README.md).
